# config_template

A clash config template.

Using [**Proxy Provider**](https://lancellc.gitbook.io/clash/clash-config-file/proxy-provider) and [**Rule Provider**](https://lancellc.gitbook.io/clash/clash-config-file/rule-provider), auto update.

This config is only compatible with [**Premium Core**](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases/tag/premium), which is integrated by [CFA](https://github.com/Kr328/ClashForAndroid/releases) and [CFW](https://github.com/Fndroid/clash_for_windows_pkg/releases) out of the box.

A free shortened link service (like [short.io](https://short.io/)) is highly recommended so that you can easily renew your subscriptions at any time without having to customize the rules again.
